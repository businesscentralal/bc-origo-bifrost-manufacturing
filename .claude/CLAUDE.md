## Microsoft source
Business Central manufacturing (production orders, production BOMs, routings, work and machine centers, output and consumption) lives in the **Base Application**; BC 28 has no separate Microsoft manufacturing app to depend on. Source: https://github.com/microsoft/BCApps/tree/main/src/Layers/W1/BaseApp/Manufacturing
`main` of BCApps is a newer release than BC 28.5; read the matching `releases/28.x` branch when you need the exact 28.5 source.
Read it there before designing message types.

## Setup Notifications
Setup notifications live **only** on Bifröst Foundation's `Setup ori` page. This app never raises a `Notification` of its own.
It makes itself known to Foundation by subscribing to `App Registry ori.OnRegisterApps` and calling `AddApp` with this
app's module id, its display name and its setup page id (`0` while the app has no setup page). Follow
`app/src/Common/SubRegistration.Codeunit.al` in Bifrost Subscription Billing.

## Target BC Version
28.5 (application 28.5.0.0, platform 28.0.0.0, runtime 17.0)

## Source Control
Platform: GitHub
Organization: businesscentralal
Repository: bc-origo-bifrost-manufacturing
Default branch: main

## Dependencies
- Base Application (application floor 28.5.0.0)
- Bifrost Foundation (`7505e808-6e52-4b96-a328-82573391297a`, 28.0.5.590, same floor as Bifrost Subscription Billing)

## Naming Rules
- Every object carries the `ori` suffix (AppSource mandatory affix), max 30 characters.
- The brand name "Bifrost" lives in the namespace, the app name ("Bifrost Manufacturing"), the permission sets and
  user-facing captions - never as an object-name prefix.
- Message type names have three parts: `Domain.Entity.Action`.
- Icelandic captions use "Bifröst".

## Development Standards

This project follows the **Origo BC Development Standards** (https://github.com/OrigoSoftwareSolutions/bc-dev-standards).

Before writing any AL code, load the relevant skills: `origo-bc-al-coding-standards`, `origo-bc-test-writer`, `origo-bc-documentation-writer`.

Key rules always in effect:
- Namespace `Origo.Bifrost.Manufacturing` at the top of every app file (`Origo.Bifrost.Manufacturing.Test` in tests)
- XML documentation on every object and non-local procedure
- Bilingual captions (en-US + is-IS) on all user-facing text
- `SetLoadFields` on all record reads
- `Format(guid, 0, 4)` for GUIDs, `Format(value, 0, 9)` / `Evaluate(var, text, 9)` for culture-invariant serialization
- Never use `Format()` / `Evaluate()` on enum values - use `.Names()`, `.Ordinals()`, `.AsInteger()`, `.FromInteger()`
- Implementation = code + tests + documentation (the contract chapters of `Msg Contract ori`)

## Development Environment
- COSMO Alpaca containers are defined in `app/.vscode/launch.json` (git-ignored, the authority for instance ids).
- Compile locally with alc.exe + CodeCop/UICop/AppSourceCop; AL-Go CI is the gate for AppSource affix rules (AS0011).
- `app/AppSourceCop.json` sets `mandatoryAffixes`/`mandatorySuffix` to `ori` and the supported countries.
- Reference implementation: Bifrost Subscription Billing (businesscentralal/bc-origo-bifrost-subscription-billing).

## Message Type Conventions
- One enum extension of Foundation's `Message Type ori` with one value per type, named `Domain.Entity.Action`. These
  keys are the published external API contract and must never be renamed or removed.
- Each type has an Impl codeunit implementing `Msg Interface ori`, `Msg Discovery ori` and `Msg Contract ori`, with
  `TableNo = "Message Argument ori"` and an `OnRun` that runs its own write, as in Bifrost Subscription Billing.
- Errors are returned as `status = Error` with a helpful message; never let an unhandled exception reach the API.

## Test App Rules
- The test app uses Bifröst Foundation's public API only. Run message types through the public `Dispatcher ori`.

## Testing Through the MCP Server
- Keep MCP calls serial - parallel bursts crash the server.
